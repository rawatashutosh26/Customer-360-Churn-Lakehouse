# 🛒 Enterprise Customer 360 & Churn Prediction Lakehouse

## 📌 Project Overview
A full-lifecycle **Data Engineering & Machine Learning** project designed to identify high-value customers and predict churn risks. 

Built on **Azure Databricks**, this solution processes raw ERP transaction logs, builds a "Customer 360" feature store using **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), and deploys a **Logistic Regression Model** to predict future purchasing behavior. The final insights are delivered via an interactive **Power BI** dashboard.

## 🏗 Architecture & Tech Stack
* **Platform:** Azure Databricks (Community Edition)
* **Storage:** Delta Lake (Medallion Architecture: Bronze $\to$ Silver $\to$ Gold)
* **Compute:** Apache Spark (PySpark)
* **Machine Learning:** Spark MLlib (Logistic Regression)
* **Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Language:** Python, SQL, DAX

## 🔧 Pipeline Breakdown
### 1. Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
* Ingested raw CSV transaction data from the Online Retail dataset.
* Implemented **Schema Enforcement** to handle data type validation at the source.
* Archived raw history in **Delta Tables**.

### 2. Transformation (Silver Layer)
* Performed data cleaning: Handling null CustomerIDs and formatting timestamps.
* Deduplicated records to ensure data integrity.
* Used **Delta Lake MERGE** logic (simulated) for upserts.

### 3. Feature Engineering (Gold Layer)
* Aggregated transaction logs into a **Customer 360 Profile**.
* Calculated **RFM Metrics**:
    * **Recency:** Days since last purchase.
    * **Frequency:** Total count of orders.
    * **Monetary:** Total lifetime spend.
* Created target labels (`is_high_value`) for the ML model.

### 4. Machine Learning & BI
* Trained a **Spark ML Logistic Regression** model to classify customers.
* Achieved **95% Accuracy** on test data.
* Visualized "At-Risk VIPs" in Power BI to drive retention campaigns.
